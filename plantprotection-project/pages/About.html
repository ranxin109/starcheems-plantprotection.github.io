					<h2>IAPPS Aims and Activities</h2>
					<p>The prime aim of IAPPS is to promote the development of an integrated approach to research on plant protection and to its world-wide practical application.</p>
					<p>With an increasing world population and the associated need for increased food production, effective and sustainable plant protection practices have an increasingly important role to play. The implementation of an integrated approach to plant protection to achieve effective and resilient plant protection strategies involves:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>a scientific understanding of factors affecting pest population dynamics, including the role of natural control mechanisms,</li>
						<li>the implementation of best on-farm management practices that, in combination, achieve improved plant protection outcomes, and</li>
						<li>a coordinated and effective regulatory, policy and training environment.</li>
						<li>The IAPPS <a href="" class="blue-a" style="color: black;">Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)</a> statement and commitment can be accessed <a href="" class="blue-a">here</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>In this context, IAPPS seeks to contribute to its aim through the following structure and functions.</p>
